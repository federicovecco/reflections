1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates an empty repository. that means a repository without any commit done. We need to do it because if we don't initialize a new repository git won't know where send the commits (?)

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is a previous step to the commit. It's a state between the working directory and the repository. I think we can do a logical change to a file without touching the one on the working directory but before doing the commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	?

4. What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

5. How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

6. What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

7. What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
